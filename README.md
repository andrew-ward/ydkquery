# YDKTools

A set of Python libraries for reading, writing, and generally working with various decklist formats.

Primarily designed for use in statistical analysis programs involving yugioh cards. It allows you to open .ydk decks as used by YGOPro, and manipulate the cards and deck as native python objects.


For examples on how to use the library, you can look at the ydktools application.

Get price information using the yugiohprices.com api, convert between decklist types, and perform increasingly specific searches.

Most of the functionality is exposed by the ygo.Session class, making it easy to use for client applications or even just single file one-off scripts.

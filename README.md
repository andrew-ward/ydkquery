# YDKTools

A set of Python libraries for reading, writing, and generally working with various decklist formats.

Primarily designed for use in statistical analysis programs involving yugioh cards. It allows you to open .ydk decks as used by YGOPro or DevPro, and manipulate the cards and deck as native python objects.


Most of the functionality is exposed by the ygo.Session class. Full documentation to come.
